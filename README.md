East Antarctica repo for code and figures for the paper will come soon.

We investigate the mass balance of East Antarctica over the period 2003 to 2013 via a Bayesian statistical framework.  We combine laser and radar altimetry, gravimetry and GPS along with prior assumptions characterizing the underlaying geophysical processes. 

 - Study sensitivity to the regional climate model
 - Study sensitivity to GRACE
 - Study sensitivity to altimetry
 - ICB corrections
